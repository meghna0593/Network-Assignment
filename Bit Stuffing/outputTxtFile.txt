The Nobel Prize in physics recognizes two more significant pieces of work on lasers. Arthur Ashkin, a former employee of Bell Labs in the US, got the prize for developing optical tweezers and their application to biological systems. Gerard Mourou of Ecole Polytechnique in France and Donna Strickland of the University of Waterloo in Canada have been awarded for their method of generating high-intensity, ultra-short optical pulses.(It is worth noting that Strickland is the first woman in 55 years and the only the third woman to win a Nobel Prize in physics.
